# Convolutional-Networks
- This is just a basic implementation of the convolutional layers to the ANN.
- Moreover, this notebook contains how to dynamically input the kernel size for the CV layers and so that we can compare the models with
  different kernel sizes.
- Visualization of the performance of the models and images(IMSHOW).
- Optimizer : SGD.
- Loss Function : CrossEntropyLoss.
- Pytorch (GPU computing), However it needs CUDA which only comes with NVIDIA.
- You can use plaidML for AMD GPU's, even though its still progress.
